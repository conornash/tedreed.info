I thought I'd make a quick introductory post to explain what sort of content I expect to blog about.

The biggest topic I've been wanting to blog about lately are the various pieces of my highly-customized setup, involving xmonad and vim and the like. I regularly have people coming by my desk at work who are amazed by the speed with which I move around and edit files. I also regularly find new vim plugins or other scripts that make my life easier, and it's always nice to share.

I also sometimes feel the need to opine about topics relevant to programming or sysadmin work. In particular, as an engineery-sort-of sysadmin, I frequently find myself working right at the seam between these two, and there are some rough patches I sometimes feel it'd be worthwhile to address.
